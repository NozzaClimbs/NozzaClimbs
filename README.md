- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NozzaClimbs
Completely new to IT. Eventually hoping to be able to 'walk' on my own eventually, but for the moment i'm just learning to 'crawl'.
Currently learning CSS and just started using it via Sass. Soon might start JavaScript learning.
Hoping this will be a long term pursuit.

Thanks
